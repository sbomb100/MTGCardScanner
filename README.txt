This is a project to 
1) Scan MTG Cards via camera and Obtain their information (Done!)
2) look these cards up in a MTG Database to get all information (Done!)
3) store these in a personal databse for fast query search in case of deck building (Done!)

Instruction:
- Currently, give the image of the card to the scanner (a light solid color background is best)
- For future implementations, as of right now, the plan is to expect users to not attempt to track the same card 2 times in a row.
    for new database updates, show different cards or restart the scanner to add additional cards.

- Run list finder with a given text document to get the info for it
- run scanner to scan cards
- run the database files for creation.

Possible add-ons:
- name search
- allow query of list of cards like youd recieve in moxfield


#NEXT STEPS 
#- change from single image to image stream
#  > get camera to focus
#  > change single image to camera feed
#  > make continual reads of the same card not multiple upload
#  >
#- combine the camera and deck query features to make it easier to go between them.
#  > GUI? some kind of user interaction for easier use
#  > adjust the text docuement to be a shown display as well, allow choice of text doc, edit prompts to be easier to not mess up
#
#- perhaps shift into website or app to make it easier to use
#  > i dont know ios development
#  > i do not have an android
#  > website would require my camera to work still
