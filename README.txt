This is a project to 
1) Scan MTG Cards via camera and Obtain their information (Done!)
2) look these cards up in a MTG Database to get all information (Done!)
3) store these in a personal databse for fast query search in case of deck building (Done!)


Possible add-ons:
- name search
- allow query of list of cards like youd recieve in moxfield


#NEXT STEPS 
#- change from single image to image stream
#  > get camera to focus
#  > change single image to camera feed
#  > make continual reads of the same card not multiple upload
#  >
#- make it able to search the personal databse given a moxfield deck list
#  > sqlquery loop for each card, print out cards i owned
#  > proxy vs lgs: for cards I dont have, sort into <$1 >$1 to determine wether to proxy the rest
#- perhaps shift into website or app to make it easier to use
#  > i dont know ios development
#  > i do not have an android
#  > website would require my camera to work still
